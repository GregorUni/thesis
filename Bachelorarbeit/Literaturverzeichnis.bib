AEGIS-128 uses five AES round functions to process a 16-byte message block (one step); AES-256 uses six AES round functions. The security analysis shows that both algorithms offer a high level of security. On the Intel Sandy Bridge Core i5 processor, the speed of AEGIS is around 0.7 clock cycles/byte (cpb) for 4096-byte messages. This is comparable in speed to the CTR mode (that offers only encryption) and substantially faster than the CCM, GCM and OCB modes.},

We then analyze the security of authenticated encryption schemes designed by ``generic composition,'' meaning making black-box use of a given symmetric encryption scheme and a given MAC. Three composition methods are considered, namely Encrypt-and-MAC plaintext, MAC-then-encrypt, and Encrypt-then- MAC. For each of these, and for each notion of security, we indicate whether or not the resulting scheme meets the notion in question assuming the given symmetric encryption scheme is secure against chosen-plaintext attack and the given MAC is unforgeable under chosen-message attack. We provide proofs for the cases where the answer is ``yes'' and counter-examples for the cases where the answer is ``no.''},

  abstract  = {Poly1305-AES is a state-of-the-art message-authentication code suitable for a wide variety of applications. Poly1305-AES computes a 16-byte authenticator of a variable-length message, using a 16-byte AES key, a 16-byte additional key, and a 16-byte nonce. The security of Poly1305-AES is very close to the security of AES; the security gap is at most 14D⌈L/16⌉/2106 if messages have at most L bytes, the attacker sees at most 264 authenticated messages, and the attacker attempts D forgeries. Poly1305-AES can be computed at extremely high speed: for example, fewer than 3.1l{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}780 Athlon cycles for an ℓ-byte message. This speed is achieved without precomputation; consequently, 1000 keys can be handled simultaneously without cache misses. Special-purpose hardware can compute Poly1305-AES at even higher speed. Poly1305-AES is parallelizable, incremental, and not subject to any intellectual-property claims.},

We deﬁne a general attack strategy using a simpliﬁed model of the cache to predict timing variation due to cache-collisions in the sequence of lookups performed by the encryption. The attacks presented should be applicable to most high-speed software AES implementations and computing platforms, we have implemented them against OpenSSL v. 0.9.8.(a) running on Pentium III, Pentium IV Xeon, and UltraSPARC III+ machines. The most powerful attack has been shown under optimal conditions to reliably recover a full 128-bit AES key with 213 timing samples, an improvement of almost four orders of magnitude over the best previously published attacks of this type [Ber05]. While the task of defending AES against all timing attacks is challenging, a small patch can signiﬁcantly reduce the vulnerability to these speciﬁc attacks with no performance penalty.},
